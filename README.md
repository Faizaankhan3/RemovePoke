RemovePoke
==============================
Recently with launch of PokemonGo, our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) timeline got flooded with Pokemon related posts. But There are many people who is not interested in the Pokemon. And they hate their timeline being flooded with such post.

This Chrome extension will simply block all such posts. There is no configuration. 

You can simply **Download the extension from [here](https://github.com/vikas-0/RemovePoke/raw/master/bin/RemovePoke.crx)** and Add to your chrome browser, or you can clone the project and load into the chrome by turning developer option on.
